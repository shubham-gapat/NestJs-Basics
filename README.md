## Description
NestJS is an open-source framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It leverages the features of TypeScript while fully supporting JavaScript. The framework is built on top of Express.js (or optionally Fastify) and incorporates modern JavaScript concepts, design patterns, and a modular architecture.
